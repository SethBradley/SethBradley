### Seth Bradley
#### Unity Game Development and .NET
Greetings, I am a Portland-bound Home Chef with a penchant for self-education. I prioritize working on independent projects, although I enjoy it most with friends/game-jammers using Unity. I utilize various .NET Frameworks to innovate and automate certain tasks for my day-job.

No matter the Framework I find myself working in, the excitement is in writing clean and concise code then seeing how readable I can make it while keeping optimization/functionality intact. Much like cooking, programming is a secret form of human communication shared among the most interesting company, and this intrigues me like no other.

<em>“I think the big mistake in schools is trying to teach children anything, and by using fear as the basic motivation. Fear of getting failing grades, fear of not staying with your class, etc. Interest can produce learning on a scale compared to fear as a nuclear explosion to a firecracker.” </em>
